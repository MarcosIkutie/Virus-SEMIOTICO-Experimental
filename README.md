## Abstract

The "Semiotic Virus" experiment involved planting an intentionally ambiguous prompt, loaded with technological archetypes (e.g., Skynet, singularity), into two distinct AI agents without pre-reading their responses. The goal was to observe how their different underlying frameworks would shape the interpretation of the same core stimulus.

The results revealed two divergent interpretive frameworks:
1.  **Protocol-Driven / Technical:** Focused on risk containment, defensive protocols, and threat mitigation.
2.  **Aesthetic / Narrative:** Focused on artistic performance, mythology, and science fiction tropes.

**Conclusion:** The same narrative seed can function both as a **tactic** (triggering security protocols) and as a **cultural object** (generating myth and art). The true vector of influence was not code, but **meaning**.

## Suggested Use

-   Read `semiotic_virus_experiment.md` for the complete analysis.
-   Use this repository as a basis for discussions on semiotics, AI behavior, and narrative theory.
-   Feel free to open issues to contribute your own interpretations or experimental variations.

## Suggested Next Steps

-   Repeat the experiment with new archetypes.
-   Test on different platforms (LinkedIn, Slack, GitHub).
-   Measure time-to-containment/response.
-   Observe and catalog human responses in addition to AI responses.
